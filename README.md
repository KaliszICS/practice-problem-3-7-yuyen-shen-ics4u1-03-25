# Instructions  

1. Create a method called _searchMazeMoves_, which takes a 2-D String array as a parameter, that searches a maze to find the minimum number of moves required to go from the start to the finish.  It will return the number of moves as an integer.  This method should be able to move in all directions.

The start will always be the bottom left and denoted by an "S".  The finish can be anywhere and will always be denoted by an "F". Walls will be denoted by a "*".
